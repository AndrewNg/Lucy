# How to get started

1. Clone the repository
  * `git clone git@github.com:AndrewNg/Lucy.git`
2. In Google Chrome, open up your extensions page located at chrome://extensions
3. Enable Developer Mode
4. Click "Load Unpacked Extension" and select Lucy as the directory
5. If this is your first time using Lucy, we have to do a little hack to enable Lucy to get access to your microphone
  * First, right click Lucy's extension icon and click "Options". You can also get to this page by clicking "Options" on the extension page
  * You should see Lucy request access to your microphone. Give her access!
6. Open a new page (say http://www.google.com) and click on Lucy's extension icon located on the right side of the navigation bar
6. Say "Lucy" and wait for a ding
7. You're good to go! Give it commands like "search for HackPrinceton", "go to CNN", "scroll down", or even "click the link about the Final Four".

# Debugging
If you're having trouble getting Lucy set up, click on "background page" underneath Lucy in chrome://extensions. Send us an email at ajng@princeton.edu with your logs if you're having trouble and we'll try to get you set up!
