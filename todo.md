# Bugs that we know of
* Lucy doesn't work out of the box (i.e, on the extension page or a regular new tab page. You have to go to a site first.)
* Closing a tab only works with tabs created after Lucy has been initialized
* Commands only work on pages where JavaScript is enabled

# Improvements
* An easy way to turn on and turn off Lucy (binding an action to pressing the extension button)
* Indication that Lucy is working after you click the button
* Not failing silently
* Identifying text boxes for typing and typing in said boxes
* New extension icon
* Clean up the code (lol)
