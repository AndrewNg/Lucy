# Bugs that we know of
Navigation sometimes searches the domain instead of navigating to it (solution, if something is said explicityly with a .com, try to visit the page)
Saying "google x" doesn't google it
Lucy doesn't work out of the box (i.e, on the extension page or a regular new tab page. You have to go to a site first.)
Indication that Lucy is working after you click the button

# Improvements
An easy way to turn on and turn off Lucy (binding an action to pressing the extension button)
Not failing silently
Identifying text boxes for typing
New extension icon
Clean up the code (lol)
